3. Two numbers comma delimited returns the sum
4. Support multiple delimiters to separate the numbers betwen the number. Again the sum 
should still be return. ~1 or ,
5. Handle more than 2 numbers 
6. Passing negative numbers will be handled by producing an error. 
7. Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored */
